# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I'm a self-taught data scientist passionate about using data to solve real-world problems — with a growing focus on **healthcare & clinical data analytics**. 
This repository is a collection of my hands-on projects as I continue learning and applying data science techniques across different domains.

## Projects

### [Patient Risk Phenotyping — PCA & K-Means Clustering](./patient-risk-phenotyping/)
> Unsupervised learning | Dimensionality Reduction | Clinical Data

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering to segment 500 patients into distinct risk phenotypes based on 11 clinical features including HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. 
The goal was to uncover hidden patient subgroups that could inform personalized healthcare strategies.

**Key techniques:** PCA, K-Means, StandardScaler, Elbow Method, Correlation Analysis  
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, statsmodels

### [House Price Prediction — Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge & LASSO](./housing-prediction/)
> Supervised Learning | Regression | Regularization | Model Diagnostics

Built and compared regression models to predict house prices using 13 property and neighbourhood features including lot size, crime rate, distance to city center, and energy efficiency score. 
The project follows a full ML workflow — from EDA and OLS inference through to assumption validation and regularization.

**Key techniques:** Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge (L2), LASSO (L1), RidgeCV/LassoCV, VIF (Multicollinearity), Breusch-Pagan Test (Heteroscedasticity), Q-Q Plots (Normality), Model Persistence with pickle  
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, statsmodels, pandas, seaborn, joblib
